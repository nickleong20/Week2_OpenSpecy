# Week 2: Open Specy
Open Specy is a tool that can analyze plastic and environmental samples and then compare them to a metadata library to allow users to determine the type of material they are made of. This data can then be shared with the Open Specy community to expand the materials library.  


## How it works
The [Open Specy website](https://openanalysis.org/openspecy/) reads spectral data files (.asp, .csv, .jdx, .spc, .spa, and .0) and displays them on an easy-to-read spectra plot. It then gives users the ability to preprocess their data using sliders that control smoothing, baseline correction, and spectral range. Once this is done, the site compares the plots to either a Raman or FTIR spectra and displays the most similar plots from its library. The results contain Pearson's r correlation values to show how correlated the plots are, as well as the material, sample ID, and organization/affiliations.
